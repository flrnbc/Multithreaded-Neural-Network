# Some development notes

# TODOs 
  These are divided into two categories 
  #A: important and possibly implemented before submission
  #B: not so urgent (possiblity still added before submission)

# Activation vs ActivationFct
  We (loosely) follow the rule: Activation refers to the name of an 
  activation function ActivationFct. The point we are trying to make:
  PerceptronData is 'pure data' whereas Perceptron contains the actual
  functions as well.

# 'Global TODOs'
  + Where to use move semantics or passing by reference?
